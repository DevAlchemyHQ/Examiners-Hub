# Deployment Status - Final Summary

## ✅ All Commits Successfully Pushed

**Remote**: `ex_ch_10224` (https://github.com/DevAlchemyHQ/ex_ch_10224.git)  
**Branch**: `main`  
**Latest Commit**: `398d4c8`

## Commits Deployed

1. **ec65e13** - fix: ensure all browsers read/write the same DynamoDB project record
2. **9ae4302** - fix: prevent old data from overwriting new data in cross-browser sync
3. **398d4c8** - fix: add localStorage fallback when AWS data is skipped

## What These Fixes Do

### Fix 1: Deterministic Project Selection

- Changed DynamoDB query from `QueryCommand` (non-deterministic) to `GetCommand` (deterministic)
- All browsers now use `project_id='current'`
- Result: All browsers read/write the SAME project record

### Fix 2: Timestamp Protection

- Added timestamp comparison in `loadAllUserDataFromAWS`
- Only overwrites local data if AWS data is newer
- Result: New data is protected from being overwritten by old AWS data

### Fix 3: localStorage Fallback

- When AWS data is skipped (older than local), load from localStorage
- Result: FormData always displays, even when timestamp protection prevents AWS data

## Deployment Status

**Status**: ✅ Commits pushed to `ex_ch_10224:main`  
**Amplify Auto-Deploy**: Should trigger automatically (2-3 min)  
**Testing**: Ready after Amplify deployment completes

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

✅ Changes sync across all browsers  
✅ Subsequent changes persist (don't revert)  
✅ Data doesn't get overwritten by older AWS data  
✅ FormData loads from localStorage when needed
