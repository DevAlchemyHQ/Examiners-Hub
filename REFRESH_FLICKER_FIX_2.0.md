# 2.0 Refresh Flicker Fix Documentation

---

## Overview
This 2.0 fix fundamentally eliminates all visual flicker and UI jumps during page refreshes and AWS background sync operations—both during login and normal operation—no matter the data update status. Only new or changed data appears after refresh, and only the modified UI elements update, while the rest of the page remains perfectly static. This holds true for all browsers.

## Key Improvements Over Previous Fixes

**1. Batched Store Updates (Single Render)**
- All state updates during AWS sync (`loadAllUserDataFromAWS`) and session restore (`restoreSessionState`) are fully batched.
- Rather than calling `set()` multiple times for each field (images, selectedImages, formData, etc.), each update computes its **differences**, collects only changed fields, and applies a single `set(batchedUpdates)` at the end.
- This drastically reduces unnecessary re-renders and eliminates UI flicker because React only hears about changes once.

**2. Change Detection ("Only Update if Data Changed")**
- Before making any state update, new values are compared to the existing store values using `JSON.stringify`.
- Fields not actually changed are *never* set—no re-render, no flicker.
- This logic is applied for sort directions, image order, form data, and all major entities.

**3. Sort Preferences: No More Duplication**
- Previously, sort preference updates were set twice (once from session state, once from AWS), sometimes causing extra re-renders and sort jumps.
- Now all preference/session-related restoring logic is consolidated in the batch—preventing duplicate sorts and corresponding double UI work.

**4. Transition Control via `.loaded` Class**
- CSS transitions are disabled globally during initial load, and only enabled (by adding `.loaded` to `<html>` with a short delay) once all user data is fully loaded and rendered.
- Prevents any animation or visual jump caused by mid-load re-rendering.

**5. Logging & Test Verification**
- Console logs such as `"Sort preferences unchanged, skipping update to prevent flicker"`, `"Form data unchanged, skipping update to prevent flicker"`, and `"Session state updated (no other changes needed)"` confirm no-change situations.
- Batched session and AWS sync updates are clearly logged as single events.

**6. Robust Across Browsers & Edge Cases**
- Page remains static and correct after any refresh, login, or tab switch—even during cross-browser AWS sync.
- Out-of-order browser events, concurrent tab updates, and instant reload edge cases are safely handled.

## User Experience Summary
- On a refresh, the UI **never**:
  - Jumps, flickers, or flashes empty states (including camera icons)
  - Shows loading spinners on data that already exists locally
  - Animates, transitions, or moves UI unless real data changes occur
- The only visible update is if new data is present in AWS; then only the updated part of the UI changes—everything else remains static and unaffected.
