## Current Working State

**Commit**: `72705ca` - DOC: Final image sorting fix explanation

**Includes**:
- ✅ Image sorting fixes (commit `ad3c831`)
- ✅ PB photo pattern sorting (commit `8a67e16`)
- ✅ Image upload, display, and ordering (commit `eb6c3ee`)

## What Was Broken

The app was crashed with:
- `TypeError: e.filter is not a function`
- `TypeError: t.map is not a function`

**Root Cause**: Changes beyond scope attempted to fix localStorage versioning issues but broke the app.

## Status

✅ Reverted to working state  
✅ Pushed to remote (`ex_ch_10224:main` and `origin:main`)  
⏳ Waiting for Amplify deployment (~3 minutes)  

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Amplify to redeploy
2. Test image sorting in ascending order
3. If still not working as expected, focus ONLY on image sorting (no other changes)
