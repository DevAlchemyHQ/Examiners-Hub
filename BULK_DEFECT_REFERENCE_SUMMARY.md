## 🔧 Bulk Defect Functionality

### Core Features Working

1. **Defect Creation and Management**

   - Add new defects with auto-incrementing photo numbers
   - Edit photo numbers with validation (numbers + letters)
   - Edit descriptions with character validation
   - Delete defects with undo functionality
   - Drag and drop reordering with auto-renumbering

2. **File Selection System**

   - Dropdown selection from available images
   - Drag and drop from image grid to defect tiles
   - File deselection and cleanup
   - Synchronization with bulk selected images

3. **Bulk Text Import**

   - Parse defect format: "Photo 01 ^ description ^ date filename.JPG"
   - Parse simple text format (one description per line)
   - Automatic photo numbering
   - Missing image detection and validation
   - Error handling for malformed text

4. **Validation System**

   - Individual defect validation (photo number, description, file)
   - Bulk validation (at least one defect with image)
   - Form data validation (ELR, Structure No, Date)
   - Character validation (no / or \ in descriptions)

5. **Data Persistence**
   - Auto-save to localStorage
   - Auto-save to AWS DynamoDB
   - Cross-session persistence
   - Filename matching for image restoration
