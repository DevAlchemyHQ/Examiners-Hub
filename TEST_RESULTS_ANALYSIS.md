# Test Results Analysis - Selected Images Persistence

## Test Conducted
1. ‚úÖ Navigated to app
2. ‚úÖ Selected image "PB080001 copy.JPG"
3. ‚úÖ Added description "FINAL PERSISTENCE TEST - 123"
4. ‚úÖ Console shows: "Selected images auto-saved to AWS"
5. ‚ùå **Refreshed page ‚Üí Selection disappeared**

## Console Logs Analysis

### When Image Was Selected
```
üîß toggleImageSelection - Added image: {id: img_35f7d584, instanceId: img_2959c5f5}
‚úÖ Versioned data saved: project_proj_6c894ef_selections (v2)
üì± Selected images saved to localStorage (versioned): [Object]
‚úÖ Selected images auto-saved to AWS
```

### After Refresh
Looking for logs that show what was loaded...

**Key log found**: `‚ö†Ô∏è No selectedImages found in storage or empty array`

## Issue Identified

Even though we're saving with `selectedWithFilenames`, it's still loading as empty array.

**Looking at the console logs more carefully**, I need to check what data is ACTUALLY in localStorage.

## Next Steps

Need to:
1. Check what data format is in localStorage key `project_proj_6c894ef_selections`
2. Verify if `loadVersionedData` is actually loading the data
3. Check if migration is returning empty array

## Hypothesis

The fix may be saving data correctly, but there might be an issue with:
1. The data format in localStorage
2. The loading logic
3. The migration logic returning empty array

Let me check the browser console logs more carefully to see what was actually loaded.
