# Test Findings - Selected Images Persistence

## Test Conducted

### Steps

1. Navigated to app: ‚úÖ Loaded successfully
2. Selected image: ‚úÖ Image "PB080001 copy.JPG" selected, counter shows "(1)"
3. Added description: ‚úÖ "TEST PERSISTENCE 123" typed into description field
4. Console shows saved: ‚úÖ `Versioned data saved: project_proj_6c894ef_selections (v2)`
5. Refreshed page: ‚ùå **SELECTED IMAGE DISAPPEARED**

### Console Logs Analysis

**Before refresh (after selection):**

```
‚úÖ Versioned data saved: project_proj_6c894ef_selections (v2)
‚úÖ Selected images auto-saved to AWS
```

**After refresh:**

```
üì• Loaded selectedImages from storage: []
‚ö†Ô∏è No selectedImages found in storage or failed to load
```

## Root Cause

**Issue**: Despite saving with `saveVersionedData()`, the selection is being loaded as empty array `[]`.

**Console log shows**: `Loaded selectedImages from storage: []`

This means:

1. Data IS being saved (logs confirm versioned save succeeded)
2. Data IS being loaded (logs show load attempt)
3. **BUT the loaded data is an empty array `[]`**

## Possible Causes

1. **Data format mismatch**: Maybe `saveVersionedData` is saving but `loadVersionedData` is extracting wrong data
2. **Timing issue**: Maybe migration is failing or returning empty array
3. **Key mismatch**: Maybe wrong localStorage key being used

## Evidence

- ‚úÖ `saveVersionedData()` is being called (commit fafda01, cf4f0df applied)
- ‚úÖ Console shows "Versioned data saved" successfully
- ‚ùå After refresh, selections load as `[]`
- ‚ùå No images appear in selected images tile

## Next Steps

Need to investigate:

1. What data is actually in localStorage key `project_proj_6c894ef_selections`
2. What `loadVersionedData()` is returning
3. Why migration returns empty array
