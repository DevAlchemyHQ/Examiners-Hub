# Critical Fix - Selected Images Persistence

**Commit**: `c8462f6`  
**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: Deployed

---

## Problem Summary

User reported selected images disappearing after refresh across multiple browsers. Console logs revealed:

```
metadataStore.ts:1581 🔍 DEBUG: savedSelections from loadVersionedData: Array(0)
metadataStore.ts:1671 ⚠️ Migration returned empty array
metadataStore.ts:2148 📸 Selected images loaded from AWS: 0
idGenerator.ts:101 ✅ Versioned data saved: project_proj_6c894ef_selections (v2)
```

**Root Cause**: The `loadAllUserDataFromAWS` function was saving empty arrays to localStorage, overwriting user selections.

---

## What Was Happening

1. User selects image → saved to localStorage ✅
2. User adds photo number and description → saved ✅
3. Background AWS sync runs
4. AWS returns **0 selections** (empty array)
5. Code saves that empty array back to localStorage ❌
6. Next refresh loads empty array → selections disappear

---

## The Fix

### File: `src/store/metadataStore.ts` (Lines 2145-2172)

**Before**:

```typescript
if (selectedImagesResult.status === "fulfilled" && selectedImagesResult.value) {
  const selectedImages = selectedImagesResult.value;
  const migratedSelections = migrateSelectedImageIds(
    selectedImages,
    currentImages
  );

  set({ selectedImages: migratedSelections });

  // ⚠️ ALWAYS saves to localStorage, even if empty array!
  saveVersionedData(keys.selections, projectId, userId, migratedSelections);
}
```

**After**:

```typescript
if (selectedImagesResult.status === "fulfilled" && selectedImagesResult.value) {
  const selectedImages = selectedImagesResult.value;

  // ✅ Only process if we actually have selections from AWS
  if (selectedImages.length > 0) {
    const migratedSelections = migrateSelectedImageIds(
      selectedImages,
      currentImages
    );

    // ✅ Only update if migration succeeded
    if (migratedSelections.length > 0) {
      set({ selectedImages: migratedSelections });

      // ✅ Only save if we have data
      saveVersionedData(keys.selections, projectId, userId, migratedSelections);
    } else {
      console.log("⚠️ Migration failed, preserving existing selections");
    }
  } else {
    console.log(
      "⚠️ AWS returned empty array - preserving existing localStorage selections"
    );
  }
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **Check if selections > 0** before processing
2. **Check if migration succeeded** before saving
3. **Preserve existing selections** when AWS returns empty
4. **Added detailed logging** for debugging

---

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:

- User selects image → saved
- AWS sync returns 0 → saves empty array
- Refresh → selections disappear ❌

### After Fix:

- User selects image → saved ✅
- AWS sync returns 0 → preserves local selections ✅
- Refresh → selections still there ✅
- Multiple refreshes → selections persist ✅
- Cross-browser → selections sync and persist ✅

## Testing

After deployment, verify:

1. Select an image
2. Add photo number and description
3. Refresh page 3 times
4. Selections should persist ✅
5. Open in another browser
6. Wait for sync (5 seconds)
7. Selections should appear ✅
8. Refresh → should persist ✅

---

## Console Logs to Watch

Look for these in browser console:

### Good Signs ✅:

```
📸 Selected images loaded from AWS: 1
✅ Selected images loaded and migrated from AWS: 1
```

### Warning Signs ⚠️:

```
⚠️ AWS returned empty array - preserving existing localStorage selections
```

This is now **expected behavior** and not an error. It means the code is correctly preserving your selections.

---

## Technical Details

### Why AWS Returns 0?

AWS might return 0 selections because:

1. User hasn't selected anything in another browser yet
2. Selections exist only in localStorage, not yet synced to AWS
3. AWS data was cleared separately

This is **normal** and the fix handles it correctly.

### Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work?

Previous fixes addressed:

- Migration logic
- Adding fileName to selections
- Fallback logic in loadUserData

But they didn't fix the core issue: **AWS overwriting localStorage with empty data**.

This fix prevents that by checking data exists before saving.
