# Root Cause Analysis - Selected Images Persistence (Second Iteration)

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Issue**: Selected images disappear after refresh despite previous "successful" test

---

## The Problem

User logs show:
```
üì• Loaded selectedImages from storage: (2) [{‚Ä¶}, {‚Ä¶}]
üîÑ Processing selected item 1: {id: 'img_734a2b2d', instanceId: 'img_66820456'}
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not migrate selected image: {id: 'img_734a2b2d', instanceId: 'img_66820456'}
fileName: unknown
```

**Key finding**: `fileName: unknown` ‚Üí Migration fails ‚Üí Selections disappear

---

## What I Thought Was Fixed

Commit `48567da` changed:
```typescript
// FROM:
saveVersionedData(keys.selections, projectId, userId, newSelected);

// TO:
saveVersionedData(keys.selections, projectId, userId, selectedWithFilenames);
```

Commit `6008aac` changed:
```typescript
// Changed function signature to include fileName:
const migrateSelectedImageIds = (
  selectedImages: Array<{ id: string; instanceId: string; fileName?: string }>,
  loadedImages: ImageMetadata[]
) => {
  let selectedFileName = (selectedItem as any).fileName || '';
  // ... rest of logic
```

## Why It's Still Broken

Looking at the actual `toggleImageSelection` code (line 1032-1058):

```typescript
toggleImageSelection: (id) => {
  set((state) => {
    const userId = getUserId();
    const selectionCount = state.selectedImages.length;
    const instanceId = generateStableImageId(userId, 'current', `${id}-selection-${selectionCount}`, selectionCount);
    const newSelected = [...state.selectedImages, { id, instanceId }];
    
    // ...
    
    const selectedWithFilenames = newSelected.map(item => {
      const image = state.images.find(img => img.id === item.id);
      return {
        id: item.id,
        instanceId: item.instanceId,
        fileName: image?.fileName || image?.file?.name || 'unknown'
      };
    });
    saveVersionedData(keys.selections, projectId, userId, selectedWithFilenames);
```

**Problem**: When `state.images` is empty or the image isn't found yet, `fileName` becomes `'unknown'`.

---

## The Real Issue

Looking at your logs:
1. **On Load from localStorage**: 
   ```
   üì• Loaded selectedImages from storage: [Object]
   fileName: 'unknown'  // ‚ö†Ô∏è fileName is 'unknown'
   ```

2. **When migrating**: 
   ```
   üîÑ Processing selected item: {id: 'img_35f7d584', instanceId: 'img_295a3a55', fileName: 'unknown'}
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Could not migrate selected image
   ```

3. **After AWS loads**:
   ```
   üì∏ Selected images loaded from AWS: 0  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration failed, got 0
   ```

---

## Why `fileName: 'unknown'`

In `toggleImageSelection` (line 1048-1054):
```typescript
const selectedWithFilenames = newSelected.map(item => {
  const image = state.images.find(img => img.id === item.id);
  return {
    id: item.id,
    instanceId: item.instanceId,
    fileName: image?.fileName || image?.file?.name || 'unknown'  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Becomes 'unknown'
  };
});
```

This happens when:
- `state.images` is empty
- `state.images` doesn't have an image with `id === item.id`
- The image hasn't loaded yet

---

## The Actual Code Flow

### Scenario 1: When image is already in state ‚úÖ
1. User clicks to select image
2. Image exists in `state.images` ‚Üí `fileName = 'PB080001 copy.JPG'`
3. Save with fileName ‚Üí Works

### Scenario 2: When image isn't in state yet ‚ùå
1. User clicks to select image
2. Image NOT in `state.images` yet ‚Üí `fileName = 'unknown'`
3. Save with `fileName: 'unknown'` ‚Üí Migration fails ‚Üí Selection disappears

---

## Migration Logic Flow

In `migrateSelectedImageIds` (line 372-474):
```typescript
let selectedFileName = (selectedItem as any).fileName || '';
if (selectedItem.id.startsWith('img-')) {
  // Try to derive from ID if fileName is empty
  const idParts = selectedItem.id.replace('img-', '').split('-');
  if (idParts.length > 1) {
    selectedFileName = idParts.slice(0, -1).join('-');
  }
}

// Try to find matching image
const matchingImages = loadedImages.filter(img => {
  const cleanSelected = selectedFileName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
  const cleanLoaded = (img.fileName || '').replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
  return cleanSelected === cleanLoaded || cleanSelected.includes(cleanLoaded) || cleanLoaded.includes(cleanSelected);
});

if (matchingImages.length > 0) {
  migratedSelections.push({ id: targetImage.id, instanceId: preservedInstanceId });
} else {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Could not migrate selected image');
}
```

**When `fileName: 'unknown'`**:
- `selectedFileName = 'unknown'`
- Match fails (no image has fileName: 'unknown')
- Migration returns empty array
- Selections disappear

---

## The Fix

We need to save `fileName` at the correct time, not when the image might not be loaded yet.

**Option 1: Use already-loaded image data**
Instead of looking up in `state.images` at save time, use the image metadata that's already available from the selection.

**Option 2: Store fileName separately from selections**
Keep selections and filenames in separate storage keys, updating filenames independently.

**Option 3: Store reference to original image metadata**
When selecting, store a copy of the full image metadata in the instance metadata, not just in selections.

---

## Most Likely Fix

The issue is that `toggleImageSelection` is being called before `state.images` is populated with the correct metadata (fileName).

Looking at the logs:
```
‚úÖ First image: {id: 'img_35f7d584', fileName: 'PB080001 copy.JPG', ...}
```

This shows that when images are loaded, they DO have fileName.

But when we try to save selections:
```
fileName: 'unknown'
```

This means at the time of `toggleImageSelection`, the image lookup failed:
```typescript
const image = state.images.find(img => img.id === item.id);
// image is undefined
```

---

## Conclusion

The fix needs to:
1. **Ensure images are loaded before selections are saved**
2. **Or** save fileName at a different point (e.g., when images are loaded)
3. **Or** store image metadata separately and sync it with selections

The current "fix" assumes `fileName` is always available when `toggleImageSelection` is called, but that's not always true.
