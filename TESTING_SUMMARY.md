# Testing Summary - Multiple Image Selection

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Clicking the same image multiple times was toggling it (selecting then deselecting), which prevented selecting the same image as multiple independent instances.

**Solution**: Removed toggle logic from `toggleImageSelection`. Now the same image can be selected multiple times as independent instances. Each selection creates a unique `instanceId`.

## Commit

`c96a34a` - REVERT: Remove toggle logic from toggleImageSelection

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Selecting Images:

- Clicking an image ALWAYS adds a new instance to selectedImages
- Same image can be selected multiple times
- Each selection has a unique `instanceId`
- Position depends on current sort mode:
  - **Ascending**: New images added at END (after highest photo number)
  - **Descending**: New images added at START (before highest photo number)
  - **No Sort**: New images added at END (right side)

### Deselecting Images:

- Only via the delete button on each selected image tile
- NOT by clicking the same image again in the grid

### Sort Modes:

- **Descending Sort**: Highest number first (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
- **Ascending Sort**: Lowest number first (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- **No Sort**: No sorting applied, maintains insertion order

## Testing Requirements

1. Test that same image can be selected multiple times
2. Test that images appear in correct position for each sort mode
3. Test that sorting doesn't clear descriptions
4. Test that toggling sort mode doesn't affect descriptions
