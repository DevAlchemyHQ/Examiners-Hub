# Metadata Race Condition Fix

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Commit**: `0bdc23c`  
**Issue**: Character truncation and data reversion during typing

---

## Problem

When user edits description/photo number:
1. Typing triggers immediate local save ✅
2. AWS save happens (may take 1-2 seconds)
3. Polling fetches AWS data (every 5 seconds)
4. **AWS data might be older than what user is currently typing**
5. Merge replaces newer local data with older AWS data ❌
6. Text gets truncated or reverted to old values ❌

### Example Scenario:
1. **10:00:00** - User types "Long description here" → Saves to local
2. **10:00:02** - Saves to AWS (processing time)
3. **10:00:05** - User is still typing "Long description here with more text"
4. **10:00:05** - Polling fetches AWS (has "Long description here" - old data)
5. **10:00:05** - Merge replaces "Long description here with more text" with "Long description here" ❌
6. User sees truncated text ❌

---

## Root Cause

The merge logic (lines 2647-2672) was blindly merging:
```typescript
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
const mergedMetadata = {
  ...currentState.instanceMetadata,
  ...awsInstanceMetadata  // Overwrites with potentially older data
};
```

This caused:
1. ✅ Works when AWS is newer
2. ❌ **Fails when user is actively typing** (AWS is older)
3. ❌ Text gets truncated

---

## Solution

### Smart Content Comparison

Only update if AWS has **more content** than local:

```typescript
// NEW CODE (CORRECT):
for (const key of allKeys) {
  const currentValue = currentState.instanceMetadata[key];
  const awsValue = awsInstanceMetadata[key];
  
  if (!currentValue || !currentValue.description) {
    // Local has no description, use AWS
    mergedInstanceMetadata[key] = awsValue;
    hasNewerData = true;
  } else if (awsValue && awsValue.description) {
    // Both have descriptions - use longer one (assumes more content = newer)
    if (awsValue.description.length > currentValue.description.length) {
      mergedInstanceMetadata[key] = awsValue;
      hasNewerData = true;
    } else {
      mergedInstanceMetadata[key] = currentValue;  // Keep local
    }
  }
}
```

### Logic:
- **If local has no description**: Use AWS ✅
- **If both have descriptions**: Use the one with **more characters** (assumes it's newer) ✅
- **If local is longer**: Keep local (user is actively typing) ✅
- **If AWS is longer**: Use AWS (newer data from other browser) ✅

## Changes Made

### File: `src/store/metadataStore.ts`

**Lines 2643-2694**: Smarter merge logic
- Compares description length
- Only updates if AWS has more content
- Preserves local edits during typing

**Line 2709**: Only save to localStorage if actually updated
```typescript
if (awsInstanceMetadata && hasNewerData) {
  saveVersionedData(..., mergedInstanceMetadata);
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### When User is Actively Typing:
1. User types "Hello world"
2. Saves to localStorage ✅
3. Polling checks AWS (has "Hello") - older ❌
4. **Local is longer** → Keep local ✅
5. User continues typing "Hello world, more text" ✅
6. No truncation ✅

### When Other Browser Updates:
1. Browser A: Types "Very long description with all details"
2. Saves to AWS ✅
3. Browser B: Has "Short description" (local) ❌
4. Polling checks AWS
5. **AWS is longer** → Update to "Very long description with all details" ✅
6. Browser B sees full description ✅

---

## Testing

1. Open Browser A
2. Edit description: "Test description 123"
3. Continue typing: "Test description 123456"
4. Should **NOT** revert to "Test description 123"
5. Open Browser B
6. Should see "Test description 123456" (after 5 seconds)

## Status

✅ Prevents character truncation  
✅ Preserves local edits during typing  
✅ Still syncs new data from other browsers  
✅ Smarter merge logic  

**Ready for deployment!** 🚀
