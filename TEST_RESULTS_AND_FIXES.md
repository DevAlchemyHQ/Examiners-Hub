# Test Results and Fixes

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Deleted Images Reappear âœ… FIXED
**Problem:** When deleting all selected images, they reappear after ~5 seconds
**Root Cause:** `startPolling` was syncing from AWS even when local state was empty, restoring deleted images
**Fix (Commit c56d66e):** Added check to skip AWS sync when `selectedImages.length === 0`

### Issue 2: Images Jump When Adding Description
**Problem:** When typing description, images jump/reorder
**Status:** Still investigating - waiting for deployment to test

### Issue 3: New Images Not Appearing at Correct Position When No Sort
**Problem:** User says "when it's not on any sorting order issue appear at the end on the right"
**Status:** Need to verify current behavior after deployment

## Testing Plan After Deployment

1. Test deletion:
   - Select multiple images
   - Click "Delete All"
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Verify images don't reappear

2. Test image selection with no sort:
   - Turn off sort
   - Select new images
   - Verify they appear at the END (right side)

3. Test description editing:
   - Add description to image
   - Type multiple characters
   - Verify image doesn't jump/reorder

4. Test image selection with sort:
   - Ascending: new images at END
   - Descending: new images at START
