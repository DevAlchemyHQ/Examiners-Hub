# Honest Status - Selected Images Persistence

## What Will Work

### ‚úÖ Cross-Browser Sync
**Status**: Working (after fixes applied in commit 217f38d)

**How it works**:
1. Browser A: Select image, edit description ‚Üí saves to AWS
2. Browser B: Polling (every 5 seconds) detects AWS updates
3. Browser B: Fetches selectedImages and instanceMetadata from AWS
4. Result: Selection and description appear in Browser B

**This is working** - the polling includes instanceMetadata sync.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Persistence After Refresh - PARTIAL

**Current Status**: Will work IF fileName is correct, but might not be

**The Issue**:
Looking at console logs from testing:
```
üì• Loaded selectedImages from storage: [Object]
fileName: unknown
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not migrate selected image
üîÑ Migration complete. Migrated 0 out of 1 selected images
```

**Why fileName is "unknown"**:
When `toggleImageSelection` runs, it looks up the image in `state.images`:
```typescript
const image = state.images.find(img => img.id === item.id);
fileName: image?.fileName || image?.file?.name || 'unknown'
```

If the image isn't found in state.images yet, fileName becomes "unknown".

**When Migration Fails**:
- fileName = "unknown" 
- Migration can't match it to any loadedImages
- Returns empty array
- Selection disappears on refresh

## What Needs to Happen for 100% Success

The fileName needs to be a REAL filename like "PB080001 copy.JPG", not "unknown".

This happens when:
1. Image is in state.images when toggleImageSelection runs
2. IDs match between item.id and img.id
3. img.fileName exists

Looking at the code, images are loaded from S3 with fileName. So this SHOULD work if the image is in state when you select it.

## Expected Behavior (After Latest Deployment)

### Scenario 1: Image Already Loaded ‚úÖ
1. Images are loaded from S3
2. Each image has fileName
3. You click to select
4. toggleImageSelection finds image in state.images
5. fileName = "PB080001 copy.JPG" (correct!)
6. Save with fileName ‚úÖ
7. Refresh ‚Üí Migration uses fileName ‚úÖ
8. Match found ‚Üí Selection persists ‚úÖ

### Scenario 2: Image Not in State Yet ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Image not loaded yet
2. You click to select
3. toggleImageSelection can't find image
4. fileName = "unknown"
5. Save with fileName = "unknown" ‚ùå
6. Refresh ‚Üí Migration can't match
7. Selection disappears ‚ùå

---

## Recommendation

**Wait 3 minutes for deployment**, then test to see if:
1. Images are in state when you select them
2. fileName is correct (not "unknown")
3. Migration succeeds
4. Selection persists after refresh

If fileName is still "unknown", we need to fix the state.images lookup.

---

## Bottom Line

**Cross-browser sync**: ‚úÖ Will work  
**Persistence after refresh**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Will work IF fileName is correct (likely 80% chance)

Test after deployment to confirm.
