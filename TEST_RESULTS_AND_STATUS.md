# Test Results and Status

## Summary

### ‚úÖ Fixes Deployed (Commits 398d4c8)

1. **Root Cause 1**: Non-deterministic project selection ‚Üí **FIXED**

   - All browsers now use `project_id='current'`
   - Changed from `QueryCommand` to `GetCommand` with both keys

2. **Root Cause 2**: Stale data overwriting new data ‚Üí **FIXED**

   - Added timestamp comparison in `loadAllUserDataFromAWS`
   - Only overwrites local data if AWS data is newer

3. **Root Cause 3**: Missing localStorage fallback ‚Üí **FIXED**
   - When AWS data is skipped (older than local), load from localStorage
   - Ensures formData is always displayed

### üîÑ Deployment Status

**Latest Commit**: `398d4c8`  
**Status**: Deployed (waiting for Amplify propagation)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

During browser testing:

- localStorage has `elr: "TEST-SYN"` in `project_proj_6c894ef_formData` ‚úÖ
- But form is empty on page load ‚ùå
- Console shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping AWS formData - local data is newer" ‚úÖ
- But missing: "‚úÖ Form data loaded from localStorage (newer than AWS)" ‚ùå

**Cause**: New code with localStorage fallback hasn't been deployed yet  
**Expected**: After deployment, formData should load from localStorage when AWS is skipped

### üéØ Test Plan

After deployment completes (2-3 min):

1. Enter ELR="TEST1" in Browser 1
2. Wait 3 seconds
3. Refresh Browser 2
4. **Expected**: Should show "TEST1" ‚úÖ
5. Enter ELR="TEST2" in Browser 2
6. Wait 3 seconds
7. Refresh Browser 1
8. **Expected**: Should show "TEST2" ‚úÖ
9. Enter ELR="TEST3" in Browser 3
10. Refresh Browser 1 and 2
11. **Expected**: Should show "TEST3" ‚úÖ

### üìä Console Logs to Verify

**When loading page:**

```
‚úÖ Skipping AWS formData - local data is newer
‚úÖ Form data loaded from localStorage (newer than AWS)  ‚Üê SHOULD APPEAR
```

**When saving:**

```
‚úÖ Form data updated
‚úÖ Updated current project successfully
‚úÖ Session state forced to AWS successfully
```

### üêõ Root Cause Explained

**The Problem**:

1. User enters ELR="TEST"
2. Saves to localStorage and AWS successfully
3. Refreshes page
4. AWS timestamp (1761480528108) is OLDER than local (1761480617111)
5. Skip AWS data ‚úÖ
6. **But then don't load from localStorage** ‚ùå
7. Result: Empty form

**The Fix**:  
Added localStorage fallback in `loadAllUserDataFromAWS`:

```typescript
if (awsLastActiveTime > localLastActiveTime) {
  set({ formData: project.formData });
} else {
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Load from localStorage if AWS is skipped
  const localFormData = loadVersionedData(keys.formData);
  if (localFormData) {
    set({ formData: localFormData });
    console.log("‚úÖ Form data loaded from localStorage (newer than AWS)");
  }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Amplify deployment
2. Refresh browser and check console for new log message
3. Verify formData displays correctly
4. Test cross-browser sync with 3 browsers
