# Final Fix: Why Browsers Show Different Data

## The Root Cause (Finally Identified)

You showed me screenshots of **two browsers with COMPLETELY DIFFERENT data**:

- Browser 1: ELR="DSCZD", No="434", Date="16/10/2025"
- Browser 2: ELR="TGDF", No="5445", Date="22/10/2025"

## Why This Happened

### The Mismatch

**localStorage** uses: `proj_6c894ef` (calculated hash)

```typescript
// From idGenerator.ts
generateStableProjectId(userId, 'current')
→ Returns: "proj_6c894ef"
```

**AWS DynamoDB** was using: `'current'` (hardcoded string)

```typescript
// OLD CODE
project_id: "current"; // Literal string!
```

### What Was Happening

Browser 1:

- Reads localStorage with key `project_proj_6c894ef_formData` → Gets "DSCZD"
- Reads AWS with `project_id='current'` → Gets "DSCZD" (also)
- Loads "DSCZD"

Browser 2:

- Reads localStorage with key `project_proj_6c894ef_formData` → Gets "TGDF"
- Reads AWS with `project_id='current'` → Gets different data
- Timestamp comparison happens
- Loads "TGDF" (from whichever is newer)

**Result**: They see different data because they're reading from **different DynamoDB records**!

---

## The Evidence

Querying DynamoDB showed:

```
Project 6: project_id='current'
  formData: { elr: 'DSCZD', structureNo: '434', date: '2025-10-16' }

Project 7: project_id='proj_6c894ef'
  formData: { elr: 'KAMP', structureNo: 'xcvcxv', date: '2025-10-26' }
```

**TWO DIFFERENT PROJECTS!** That's why browsers show different data!

## The Fix (Commit dbc64d5)

### Changed getProject()

```typescript
// OLD: Uses literal string 'current'
project_id: "current";

// NEW: Calculates deterministic hash
const deterministicProjectId = `proj_${Math.abs(hash).toString(16)}`;
// Returns: proj_6c894ef
project_id: deterministicProjectId;
```

### Changed updateProject()

```typescript
// OLD: Saves to 'current'
project_id: "current";

// NEW: Saves to proj_6c894ef
project_id: actualProjectId; // (proj_6c894ef)
```

### Migrated Existing Data

- Copied data from `project_id='current'` → `project_id='proj_6c894ef'`
- Deleted old `project_id='current'` record
- Now AWS matches localStorage ✅

---

## After Deployment

✅ All browsers will use `project_id='proj_6c894ef'`  
✅ All browsers will read/write THE SAME project  
✅ All browsers will show THE SAME data  
✅ Changes will sync correctly between browsers

---

## Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

1. **Commit ec65e13**: Changed to use 'current' in AWS, but this MISMATCHED localStorage!
2. **Commit 9ae4302**: Added timestamp protection, but browsers still read different projects
3. **Commit 398d4c8**: Added localStorage fallback, but the project IDs were still different

**The real issue**: AWS and localStorage were using DIFFERENT project IDs! That's why changes weren't syncing.

---

## Current Status

- ✅ Data migrated: 'current' → 'proj_6c894ef'
- ✅ Code updated: Both getProject and updateProject use proj_6c894ef
- ✅ Pushed to origin/main (commit dbc64d5)
- ⏳ Waiting for Amplify deployment

After deployment, test with 3 browsers to verify they all show the same data ✅
