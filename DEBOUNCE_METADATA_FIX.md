# Instance Metadata Debounce Fix

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Commit**: Latest  
**Issue**: Excessive AWS calls, data truncated during typing

---

## Problem

When user types description:
1. **Every keystroke** calls `updateInstanceMetadata`
2. Each call **saves to AWS immediately**
3. This sends **incomplete data** to AWS
4. Polling picks up the incomplete data
5. Data gets truncated or reverted

### Example:
- User types: "Hello"
- Keystroke 'H' → AWS save ❌
- Keystroke 'e' → AWS save ❌
- Keystroke 'l' → AWS save ❌
- Keystroke 'l' → AWS save ❌
- Keystroke 'o' → AWS save ❌
- **5 AWS calls for one word!** ❌

---

## Root Cause

The code at line 1001-1018 was calling AWS **immediately** on every keystroke:
```typescript
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
(async () => {
  await DatabaseService.saveInstanceMetadata(user.email, updatedInstanceMetadata);
})();
```

This caused:
1. ❌ Excessive AWS calls (costly)
2. ❌ Incomplete data being saved
3. ❌ Data truncation issues
4. ❌ Polling picks up incomplete data

## Solution

### Debounce AWS Saves

**Added** (lines 235-236):
```typescript
let instanceMetadataSaveTimeout: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
const INSTANCE_METADATA_DEBOUNCE_MS = 3000; // 3 seconds
```

**Modified** (lines 1006-1027):
```typescript
// DEBOUNCED AWS save - wait 3 seconds after user stops typing
if (instanceMetadataSaveTimeout) {
  clearTimeout(instanceMetadataSaveTimeout);
}

instanceMetadataSaveTimeout = setTimeout(async () => {
  console.log('💾 Debounced save - saving instance metadata to AWS');
  await DatabaseService.saveInstanceMetadata(user.email, updatedInstanceMetadata);
  console.log('✅ Instance metadata saved to AWS (debounced)');
  instanceMetadataSaveTimeout = null;
}, INSTANCE_METADATA_DEBOUNCE_MS);
```

### How It Works:

1. User types: "Hello world"
2. Each keystroke **saves to localStorage instantly** ✅
3. Each keystroke **cancels previous AWS save** and starts new timer
4. User stops typing for 3 seconds
5. **Only then** does AWS save happen (with complete text) ✅
6. **One AWS call per complete edit** ✅

---

## Benefits

### Before (Without Debounce):
- Typing "Hello world" (11 chars) = **11 AWS calls** ❌
- Incomplete data in AWS ❌
- Truncation issues ❌

### After (With Debounce):
- Typing "Hello world" (11 chars) = **1 AWS call** ✅
- Complete data in AWS ✅
- No truncation ✅
- Saves AWS costs by 90%+ ✅

---

## Expected Behavior

### While Typing:
1. User types "Hello"
2. Saves to localStorage instantly ✅
3. Starts 3-second timer
4. User continues typing "Hello world"
5. Timer **resets** (cancels previous)
6. User stops typing
7. After 3 seconds → **One AWS save** with "Hello world" ✅

### When Other Browser Polls:
1. AWS has complete data (not incomplete)
2. Polling picks up complete data ✅
3. No truncation ✅
4. Syncs correctly ✅

---

## Testing

1. Open Browser A
2. Type long description
3. Check network tab - should see **one AWS call** after 3 seconds
4. Open Browser B
5. Wait 5 seconds (polling interval)
6. Should see complete description (not truncated)

---

## Status

✅ Debounced AWS saves (3 seconds)  
✅ Saves to localStorage instantly  
✅ Reduces AWS calls by 90%+  
✅ Prevents truncation  
✅ Complete data syncing  

**Ready for deployment!** 🚀
