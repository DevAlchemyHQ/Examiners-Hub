# Deletion and Sort Fix - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Deletion Not Working
**Problem:** When deleting selected images, they reappear
**Status:** ✅ Deletion logic is correct in `handleInstanceDeletion`
**Likely cause:** AWS data has duplicates (seen in console logs)

### Issue 2: Images Jumping When Adding Description
**Problem:** Images jump around when adding description
**Root cause:** Sort algorithm was reordering items without numbers
**Fix:** Changed sort to preserve insertion position for items without numbers

## The Fix (Commit 5c8baed)

### Changed Logic

**Before:**
```typescript
// Put images without numbers at the end
if (aNum === 0) return 1;
if (bNum === 0) return -1;
```

This was forcing ALL items without numbers to the END, even if they were inserted at START.

**After:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Don't reorder items without numbers - preserve their insertion position
// If one item has no number, don't move it - keep it where it was inserted
if (aNum === 0) return 0;
if (bNum === 0) return 0;
```

Now items without numbers maintain their insertion position.

## How It Works Now

### Descending Mode
```
Current: [Photo #5]
User selects: New image (no number)
→ toggleImageSelection: Inserts at START → [New, Photo #5]
→ sortImages: Sees New has no number, returns 0 → Keeps at START
→ Display: [New, Photo #5] ✅
```

### Ascending Mode
```
Current: [Photo #5]
User selects: New image (no number)
→ toggleImageSelection: Inserts at END → [Photo #5, New]
→ sortImages: Sees New has no number, returns 0 → Keeps at END
→ Display: [Photo #5, New] ✅
```

### When Adding Photo Numbers
```
Current: [New (no number), Photo #5]
User adds photo #3 to New
→ No change to array order
→ sortImages: Sees both have numbers now, sorts descending
→ Display: [Photo #5, Photo #3] → [Photo #5 first] (because 5 > 3) ❌

Wait, this is wrong! Photo #5 should be first in descending.
Actually, with descending: bNum - aNum = 5 - 3 = 2, so 5 should be first ✅
```

Actually that's correct for descending mode.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Reverted to stable sort that worked
- [x] Fixed sort to preserve insertion position
- [ ] Test descending mode: new images at START
- [ ] Test ascending mode: new images at END
- [ ] Test deletion: images don't reappear
- [ ] Test adding description: no jumping
- [ ] Test adding photo numbers: correct sorting
