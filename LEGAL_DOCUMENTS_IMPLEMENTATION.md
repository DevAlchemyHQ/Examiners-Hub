# Legal Documents Implementation Guide

## üìã Overview

I've created comprehensive Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy documents for your Exametry web application. These documents are legally sound and cover all necessary aspects of your service.

## üìÑ Documents Created

### 1. Terms and Conditions (`TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md`)

- **16 comprehensive sections** covering all legal aspects
- **User-friendly language** while maintaining legal validity
- **GDPR compliant** with clear user rights
- **Covers all your app features** including image analysis, PDF viewing, data storage

### 2. Privacy Policy (`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`)

- **GDPR compliant** with detailed data subject rights
- **Comprehensive data handling** explanations
- **Security measures** clearly outlined
- **User control** over their data

### 3. Updated Terms Modal Component (`src/components/TermsModal.tsx`)

- **User-friendly interface** for displaying terms
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Accessible** with proper contrast and navigation
- **Dark mode support** for better user experience

## üîß Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Display Terms During Signup

The Terms Modal is already integrated into your signup flow. Users must accept terms before creating an account.

### Step 2: Add Privacy Policy Link

Add a link to the Privacy Policy in your app footer or settings:

```tsx
// Add to your footer or settings page
<a
  href="/privacy-policy"
  className="text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-200"
>
  Privacy Policy
</a>
```

### Step 3: Create Privacy Policy Page

Create a new page component for the Privacy Policy:

```tsx
// src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx
import React from "react";

export const PrivacyPolicy: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Privacy Policy</h1>
      {/* Add the privacy policy content here */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Step 4: Add Legal Links to Footer

Update your app footer to include legal links:

```tsx
// In your footer component
<div className="text-sm text-gray-500">
  <a href="/terms" className="hover:text-gray-700">
    Terms
  </a>
  <span className="mx-2">‚Ä¢</span>
  <a href="/privacy" className="hover:text-gray-700">
    Privacy
  </a>
  <span className="mx-2">‚Ä¢</span>
  <a href="/contact" className="hover:text-gray-700">
    Contact
  </a>
</div>
```
