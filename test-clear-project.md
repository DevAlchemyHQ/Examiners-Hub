# Test Plan: Project Tab and Clear Project Functionality

## Overview

The new Project tab has been added to the application with Clear Project functionality that clears all project data while preserving the Load Defects functionality.

## Test Cases

### 1. Project Tab Visibility

- [ ] Project tab appears in the tab bar with FolderOpen icon
- [ ] Project tab is clickable and navigates to project management view
- [ ] Project tab shows current project status (images, selected images, bulk defects)

### 2. Project Management View

- [ ] Shows project status with correct counts
- [ ] Displays "Clear Project" button
- [ ] Shows descriptive text about what gets cleared
- [ ] Button is disabled when clearing is in progress

### 3. Clear Project Functionality

- [ ] Clicking "Clear Project" shows confirmation modal
- [ ] Modal explains what will be cleared and what remains intact
- [ ] Confirmation clears:
  - Project details from DynamoDB
  - Current bulk defect entries
  - Saved images from S3
  - PDF files from S3
  - Selected images
  - Form data
  - localStorage project data
- [ ] Load Defects functionality remains intact
- [ ] Page reloads after clearing

### 4. Load Defects Preservation

- [ ] After clearing, users can still access Load Defects
- [ ] Saved defect sets are preserved
- [ ] Load Defects can load previously saved sets
- [ ] No defect set data is accidentally cleared

### 5. Error Handling

- [ ] Clear project handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Error messages are displayed to user
- [ ] Retry functionality works
- [ ] Loading states are properly managed

### 6. UI/UX

- [ ] Loading spinner shows during clearing
- [ ] Success/error messages are clear
- [ ] Modal dialogs are properly styled
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Expected Behavior

### What Gets Cleared:

- Project details entries
- Saved images
- Bulk defect entries (current working set)
- Selected images
- Form data
- PDF files
- localStorage project data

### What Remains Intact:

- Load Defects functionality
- Saved defect sets
- User authentication
- App settings

## Notes

- The clear project function is comprehensive and preserves Load Defects functionality
- All clearing operations are logged for debugging
- The function includes verification steps to ensure data is properly cleared
- Error handling is robust with fallback mechanisms
