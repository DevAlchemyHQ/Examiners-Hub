# Cross-Browser Persistence Test Plan

## Current Form Data State (Chrome)

- **ELR**: TEST01
- **Structure No**: xcvcxv
- **Date**: 2025-10-26

**Timestamp**: October 26, 2025, 11:15 AM
**AWS Save Status**: âœ… Confirmed saved successfully

---

## Test Procedure: Verify Data Persists Across Browsers

### Step 1: Wait for AWS Sync (Already Complete)

âœ… Data saved to AWS (confirmed by console logs)

### Step 2: Open Firefox (or Different Browser)

1. Launch Firefox browser
2. Navigate to: https://main.d32is7ul5okd2c.amplifyapp.com
3. Log in with credentials:
   - Email: timndg@gmail.com
   - Password: testtest11

### Step 3: Verify Form Data Loads from AWS

**Expected Result**: Form fields should show:

- ELR: TEST01
- Structure No: xcvcxv
- Date: 2025-10-26

### Step 4: Check Console Logs in Firefox

Look for these key logs:

```
âœ… Form data loaded from AWS
âœ… Session state loaded from AWS
ðŸ“‹ Project data loaded from AWS
```

### Step 5: Test Bidirectional Sync

1. In **Firefox**, update ELR to: `FIREFOX_TEST`
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Open **Chrome** (refresh the tab)
4. **Expected**: ELR should show `FIREFOX_TEST`

## Console Evidence of AWS Save

From Chrome console (just now):

```
âœ… [IMMEDIATE] Session state forced to AWS successfully
âœ… Form data force saved to AWS
âœ… Updated most recent project successfully with merged data
âœ… Form data and session state saved to AWS
```

**Project ID**: proj_6c894ef
**User**: timndg@gmail.com

## Test Checklist

- [ ] Chrome: Data saved to AWS (âœ… DONE)
- [ ] Firefox: Open app and verify form data loads
- [ ] Firefox: Check console for "Form data loaded from AWS"
- [ ] Firefox: Update a field
- [ ] Chrome: Refresh and verify updates sync
- [ ] Verify date format remains YYYY-MM-DD in Firefox

---

## Expected Behavior

### If Polling is Active:

Form data should sync within **5-10 seconds** between browsers via AWS polling.

### If Polling is Not Active:

Data will persist but won't sync automatically. Users would need to refresh to see changes from another browser.

**Note**: The `startPolling()` action needs to be initialized in App.tsx for automatic syncing (see APP_POLLING_INIT.md).

---

## Current Architecture

1. **localStorage**: Immediate, same-browser persistence
2. **BroadcastChannel**: Real-time cross-tab sync
3. **AWS DynamoDB**: Cross-browser persistence (requires load on new session)
4. **AWS Polling** (optional): Automatic cross-browser sync every 5 seconds

---

## How to Run the Cross-Browser Test

1. **Keep Chrome open** with current session
2. **Open Firefox** and navigate to the app
3. **Log in** with the same credentials
4. **Check form fields** - should match Chrome data
5. **Update a field** in Firefox (e.g., change ELR)
6. **Wait 5-10 seconds**
7. **Refresh Chrome** tab - should see Firefox changes

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… Form data persists across browsers  
âœ… Date format remains YYYY-MM-DD  
âœ… All fields (elr, structureNo, date) sync correctly  
âœ… Console logs show AWS load and save operations  
âœ… Changes in one browser appear in another (with or without polling)
