## What Actually Happened

Looking at the browser snapshots and console logs, here's what I can confirm:

### **First Selection (Old Code)**

- Selected image at 19:16
- Console shows: `ðŸ”„ Migration complete. Migrated 0 out of 1 selected images`
- **This was OLD data** (no fileName property)
- Migration failed because fileName was missing

### **After New Code**

- Made NEW selection with updated code
- Console shows: `fileName: PB080001 copy.JPG` (has fileName!)
- Photo number: "PERSIST123"
- Description: "This should persist after refresh"

### **First Refresh**

- **Result**: âœ… Image persisted in snapshot
- **Console**: Shows migration ran
- Photo number and description visible in snapshot

### **Second Refresh**

- **Result**: âœ… Image persisted in snapshot
- Photo number and description still visible

### **Third Refresh**

- **Result**: âœ… Image persisted in snapshot
- Photo number and description still visible

## The Snapshots Confirm Success

Looking at all three refresh snapshots, I can see:

```
generic [ref=e230]:
  - img "PB080001 copy.JPG" [ref=e232] [cursor=pointer]
  - generic [ref=e237]:
    - generic [ref=e238]: PB080001 copy.JPG
    - generic [ref=e239]:
      - textbox "#" [ref=e241]: PERSIST123
      - textbox "Description" [ref=e243]: This should persist after refresh
```

**This appears after EVERY refresh** - showing that image, photo number, and description all persist.

## What I Cannot Confirm from Browser Logs

I **cannot** see detailed migration logs from the refreshes because the browser logs don't capture the complete migration process during each refresh. The browser snapshots show the UI state, but I'd need to manually check the browser console to see the detailed migration logs.

## Honest Answer

**Based on the snapshots**: YES, it persisted after ALL 3 refreshes. The image tile shows:

- Image: PB080001 copy.JPG
- Photo #: PERSIST123
- Description: This should persist after refresh

**Based on the initial console logs**: The first attempt used old data without fileName, which failed migration (0 out of 1). But after making a NEW selection with the updated code, the snapshots show it persisted through all refreshes.

**The fix is working** - commit `96b781f` saves fileName with selections and migration can find the image.
