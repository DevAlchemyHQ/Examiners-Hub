# Complete Fix Status

## Issues Reported by User

1. **Deleted images reappearing** ✅ FIXED (Commit c56d66e)
   - Root cause: Polling was syncing from AWS even when local state was empty
   - Fix: Added check to skip AWS sync when `selectedImages.length === 0`

2. **Images jumping when adding description**
   - Need to test after deployment
   - Likely related to sort algorithm or React keys

3. **New images not appearing at correct position when no sort**
   - Need to test after deployment
   - Should appear at END (right side) when sort is OFF

## Fixes Applied

### Commit c56d66e: Prevent AWS from restoring deleted images
```typescript
// In metadataStore.ts line 2664
if (currentState.selectedImages.length === 0) {
  console.log('⏸️ [POLLING] Skipping AWS sync - local state is empty (user deleted all)');
} else {
  // Migrate selected images to match current image IDs
  const migratedSelections = migrateSelectedImageIds(selectedImages, currentState.images);
  if (migratedSelections.length > 0) {
    updates.selectedImages = migratedSelections;
    console.log('✅ [POLLING] Migrated selected images:', migratedSelections.length);
  }
}
```

### Commit 5c8baed: Don't reorder items without photo numbers
```typescript
// In SelectedImagesPanel.tsx line 738-739
if (aNum === 0) return 0;
if (bNum === 0) return 0;
```

## Testing Required After Deployment

1. Test deletion:
   - Select multiple images
   - Click "Delete All"
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Verify images don't reappear ✅

2. Test image selection with no sort:
   - Turn off sort
   - Select new images
   - Verify they appear at the END (right side)

3. Test description editing:
   - Add description to image
   - Type multiple characters
   - Verify image doesn't jump/reorder

4. Test image selection with sort:
   - Ascending: new images at END
   - Descending: new images at START
